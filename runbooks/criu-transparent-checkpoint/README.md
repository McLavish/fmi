# Transparent CRIU checkpoint/restore of an unmodified FMI program

This runbook checkpoints one rank of a **running, unmodified FMI application** with `criu`,
restores it, and verifies that the job finishes with exactly the results a clean run produced.

The application does not participate. `checkpoint_subject.cpp` constructs a `FMI::Communicator`
and calls `barrier`, `bcast`, `send`/`recv`, `allreduce`, `reduce`, `gather`, `scatter` and
`scan` in a loop. There is no checkpoint API in it, no migration hook, no annotation, and it
never learns that it was frozen. Everything that makes the freeze survivable happens inside the
library, below `Channel`.

## What has to be true for this to work

A checkpoint lands at an arbitrary instant and takes every socket with it (`criu --tcp-close`
drops each connection on restore). Four separate things therefore have to hold, and each was
broken at some point in getting this to run:

1. **The restored process has to stay alive.** hiredis writes without `MSG_NOSIGNAL`, so the
   first registry command after a restore — issued on the context the image captured, whose
   socket the restore dropped — delivers `SIGPIPE`. With the default disposition the rank dies
   there, before it can re-establish anything. `FMI::Utils::suppress_sigpipe` fixes this.
2. **A break anywhere in a frame has to be recoverable.** The receive watermark may only
   advance once the payload is in the application's buffer. Committing at the header instead
   lets the peer prune a message whose bytes were still in a kernel socket buffer, and nothing
   reports the loss. See `SequencedLink::commit_inline`.
3. **Retention has to be released on links the peer never writes to.** Otherwise the sender's
   window fills and the job stops — which is what happens from three ranks upward, where a
   binomial tree leaves some directed links with no return traffic to carry an ack.
4. **The restored process must be recognised as the same lineage**, not as a replacement, so
   its peers reconcile with its sequences instead of resetting them. That is what the
   incarnation in the handshake is for; a restored process keeps the one its image was taken
   with, because it never re-runs the constructor that claims a new one.

## Requirements

- `criu` (verified on 4.2) with `--unprivileged`, or run as root
- a Redis on `127.0.0.1:6379` — the DirectTCP peer registry, not the data plane
- a build of this repo with Redis enabled

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DFMI_ENABLE_S3=OFF -DFMI_ENABLE_TCPUNCH=OFF
cmake --build build -j"$(nproc)"
```

The subject lands at `build/runbooks/criu-transparent-checkpoint/fmi_checkpoint_subject`.

## One checkpoint by hand

```bash
cd runbooks/criu-transparent-checkpoint
SUBJECT=../../build/runbooks/criu-transparent-checkpoint/fmi_checkpoint_subject
COMM=demo-$$
redis-cli DEL "fmi:direct:$COMM"

for r in 0 1; do
    setsid "$SUBJECT" $r 2 fmi.json "$COMM" 20000 0 500 > /tmp/rank$r.log 2>&1 &
done
sleep 1

PID=$(pgrep -f "fmi_checkpoint_subject 1 2 .* $COMM ")
mkdir -p /tmp/img
criu dump    --unprivileged -t "$PID" -D /tmp/img --tcp-close --shell-job -v4 -o dump.log
criu restore --unprivileged        -D /tmp/img --tcp-close --shell-job -v4 -o restore.log -d

tail -2 /tmp/rank0.log /tmp/rank1.log
```

Both ranks must reach `DONE`, with the same checksums as a run that was never checkpointed.
Note that the argument list must be quoted into `pgrep` exactly as above: the rank number is
the first argument, so `fmi_checkpoint_subject 1 2` is rank 1 of 2.

## The sweep

`sweep.py` runs the same thing many times over, choosing the rank and the instant at random,
and comparing every rank's final checksum against a clean baseline of the same shape.

```bash
python3 sweep.py --trials 20 --peers 2 4 --rounds 40000 --max-checkpoints 3
```

A trial passes only if every rank reaches `DONE` with the baseline checksum **and** the
checkpointed rank logged a round after its restore. A trial whose job finished before the
checkpoint fired is reported as a failure rather than a pass — such a trial proves nothing, and
early versions of this sweep reported a clean 12/12 while checkpointing nothing at all.

`--max-checkpoints N` checkpoints up to N times per run, choosing a fresh rank each time, which
exercises a rank being frozen while a peer is itself mid-repair.

## Interpreting failures

| symptom | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `dump rc=1`, `Running as non-root requires '--unprivileged'` | pass `--unprivileged`, or run as root |
| restored rank dies with no output at all | `SIGPIPE` on the registry socket — see point 1 above |
| `sequence gap from peer N` | a frame was pruned before it was delivered — points 2 or 4 |
| `is at its retention limit` | acks are not reaching the sender — point 3 |
| `identity mismatch` | the ranks are executing different operations; a genuine protocol violation, not a checkpoint artefact |

## Scope

**Verified at 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 16 ranks — 48 randomized trials, 48 passed.** Non-powers of two
are covered deliberately: FMI's collectives are binomial trees and take a different shape when
the rank count is not a power of two.

If a rank ever does stall, it says so: after three seconds of waiting it prints what it believes
it holds on every link — descriptor, bytes queued, whether the link still owes a handshake —
which is how the last of the deadlocks here was found.

Single host. The restored rank re-uses the listening socket and advertised address the image
captured, which is correct on the same machine and wrong on any other; cross-host restore needs
the rank to re-publish its registry entry, which the migration runtime does and this runbook
does not exercise.
